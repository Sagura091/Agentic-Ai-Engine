- **Responsiveness:** Non-blocking operations
- **Scalability:** Easier to scale horizontally

**Implementation:**
```python
# All service methods are async
async def create_agent(self, config: AgentConfig) -> Agent:
    agent = await self.db.create(Agent(**config))
    await self.llm_provider.initialize(agent.llm_config)
    return agent
```

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex code (async/await everywhere)
- Harder to debug
- Requires async-compatible libraries

### Service Layer Pattern

**Decision:** Separate business logic into service classes

**Reasoning:**
- **Separation of concerns:** API layer doesn't contain business logic
- **Reusability:** Services can be used by multiple endpoints
- **Testability:** Easy to test services independently
- **Maintainability:** Clear organization

**Structure:**
```
app/api/endpoints/  ‚Üí HTTP handling
app/services/       ‚Üí Business logic
app/models/         ‚Üí Data models
```

**Trade-offs:**
- More files and classes
- Indirection between layers
- Potential over-engineering for simple operations

### Configuration-Driven Design

**Decision:** Use configuration files and environment variables for behavior

**Reasoning:**
- **Flexibility:** Change behavior without code changes
- **Environment-specific:** Different configs for dev/prod
- **Security:** Secrets in environment variables
- **Testability:** Easy to test with different configs

**Example:**
```yaml
# config/agents.yaml
default_agent:
  llm_provider: ollama
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2000
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Configuration complexity
- Need to validate configurations
- Potential for configuration drift

### Tool Registry Pattern

**Decision:** Use a centralized tool registry for agent tools

**Reasoning:**
- **Dynamic loading:** Load tools on-demand
- **Avoid circular dependencies:** Tools don't import each other
- **Discoverability:** Easy to find available tools
- **Metadata-driven:** Tools describe themselves

**Implementation:**
```python
class UnifiedToolRepository:
    def get_tool(self, tool_name: str) -> BaseTool:
        # Load tool dynamically
        return self._load_tool(tool_name)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Runtime overhead for dynamic loading
- Less type safety
- Harder to trace tool usage statically

## üîß Implementation Decisions

### UUID Primary Keys

**Decision:** Use UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers for primary keys

**Reasoning:**
- **Distributed systems:** No coordination needed for ID generation
- **Security:** IDs are not predictable
- **Merging data:** Easier to merge databases
- **API design:** IDs don't leak information about record count

**Implementation:**
```python
class Agent(Base):
    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Larger storage size (16 bytes vs 4-8 bytes)
- Slightly slower indexing
- Less human-readable

### Pydantic for Validation

**Decision:** Use Pydantic models for all API request/response validation

**Reasoning:**
- **Type safety:** Catch errors at validation time
- **Auto documentation:** OpenAPI schema generation
- **Data conversion:** Automatic type coercion
- **Clear contracts:** Explicit data structures

**Example:**
```python
class AgentCreateRequest(BaseModel):
    name: str
    agent_type: AgentType
    llm_config: LLMConfig
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Duplication between Pydantic and SQLAlchemy models
- Performance overhead for validation
- Learning curve for Pydantic features

### Structured Logging

**Decision:** Use structured logging (JSON) instead of plain text logs

**Reasoning:**
- **Searchability:** Easy to search and filter logs
- **Machine-readable:** Can be processed by log aggregators
- **Context:** Include structured context with each log
- **Debugging:** Better debugging information

**Implementation:**
```python
logger.info("Agent created", agent_id=agent.id, agent_type=agent.agent_type)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Less human-readable in raw form
- Requires log viewer for best experience
- Slightly more verbose

### Memory Tiering

**Decision:** Implement tiered memory (short-term, long-term, summarized)

**Reasoning:**
- **Performance:** Don't load entire conversation history
- **Context window:** LLMs have limited context
- **Relevance:** Recent messages more important
- **Cost:** Reduce token usage

**Architecture:**
```
Short-term (last 10 messages) ‚Üí Always included
Long-term (older messages)    ‚Üí Summarized
Semantic memory               ‚Üí Retrieved by relevance
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Complexity in memory management
- Potential information loss in summarization
- Need to tune summarization thresholds

## üé® API Design Decisions

### RESTful API Design

**Decision:** Follow REST principles for API design

**Reasoning:**
- **Familiarity:** Developers know REST
- **Tooling:** Excellent tooling support
- **Caching:** HTTP caching works well
- **Standards:** Well-established patterns

**Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/v1/agents          # List agents
POST   /api/v1/agents          # Create agent
GET    /api/v1/agents/{id}     # Get agent
PATCH  /api/v1/agents/{id}     # Update agent
DELETE /api/v1/agents/{id}     # Delete agent
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Can be verbose for complex operations
- Not ideal for real-time updates
- Over-fetching or under-fetching data

### API Versioning

**Decision:** Include version in URL path (`/api/v1/`)

**Reasoning:**
- **Clarity:** Version is immediately visible
- **Simplicity:** Easy to route different versions
- **Compatibility:** Can run multiple versions simultaneously

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Header versioning:** Less visible, harder to test
- **Query parameter:** Not RESTful
- **No versioning:** Breaking changes affect all clients

**Trade-offs:**
- URL changes when version changes
- Need to maintain multiple versions
- More complex routing

### Pagination

**Decision:** Use cursor-based pagination for list endpoints

**Reasoning:**
- **Consistency:** Results don't shift as data changes
- **Performance:** Efficient for large datasets
- **Real-time:** Works well with real-time data

**Implementation:**
```python
GET /api/v1/agents?limit=20&cursor=abc123
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Can't jump to arbitrary page
- More complex implementation
- Cursor needs to be opaque

## üîê Security Decisions

- **Standard:** 12-factor app methodology

**Trade-offs:**
- Need to manage environment variables
- Can be lost if not documented
- Harder to rotate secrets

## üìä Performance Decisions

### Connection Pooling

**Decision:** Use connection pooling for database and external services

**Reasoning:**
- **Performance:** Reuse connections instead of creating new ones
- **Resource efficiency:** Limit concurrent connections
- **Reliability:** Handle connection failures gracefully

**Implementation:**
```python
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    pool_size=20,
    max_overflow=10
)
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Need to tune pool size
- Potential connection leaks
- More complex error handling

### Caching Strategy

**Decision:** Implement multi-level caching (in-memory, Redis)

**Reasoning:**
- **Performance:** Reduce database queries
- **Scalability:** Handle more requests
- **Cost:** Reduce LLM API calls
