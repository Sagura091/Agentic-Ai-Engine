# 🎭 Autonomous Meme Agent

Your revolutionary autonomous meme-generating agent is **already built and ready to use**! 

## 🚀 What Your Agent Does

Your autonomous meme agent will:

- **🌐 Web Scraping**: Continuously collects memes from Reddit, Imgur, and 9GAG
- **🧠 AI Learning**: Analyzes patterns, templates, and humor styles from collected memes
- **🎨 Meme Generation**: Creates original memes using learned patterns and AI

## 📁 Directory Structure

The agent creates and manages:

```
memes/
├── collected/          # Memes downloaded from the web
├── generated/          # AI-generated original memes  
├── analysis_cache/     # Analysis data for learning
└── templates/          # Meme templates for generation
```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. **Make sure your backend is set up** (you already have this!)

2. **Run the launcher**:
   ```bash
   python launch_meme_agent.py
   ```

3. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - The agent will start collecting memes every 2 hours
   - It will generate new memes every 4 hours
   - All memes are saved to the `memes/` directory
   - The agent learns and improves continuously

## ⚙️ Configuration

Your agent is pre-configured with optimal settings:

- **Collection Interval**: Every 2 hours
- **Generation Interval**: Every 4 hours
- **Quality Threshold**: 0.6 (only keeps good memes)
- **Max Collection**: 50 memes per run
- **Target Subreddits**: 
  - r/memes, r/dankmemes, r/wholesomememes
  - r/PrequelMemes, r/HistoryMemes, r/ProgrammerHumor
  - r/me_irl, r/funny, r/AdviceAnimals

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

Your agent includes:

### 🎯 **Autonomous Goals**
- Continuous meme collection (200+ memes/day)
- Pattern analysis and learning
- Creative meme generation (50+ memes/day)

### 🧠 **Memory System**
- Short-term memory for recent trends
- Long-term memory for learned patterns
- Agent-specific memory isolation

### 📊 **Quality Control**
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Quality scoring and filtering
- Template recognition and extraction

### 🔄 **Proactive Behaviors**
- Time-based collection triggers
- Condition-based analysis triggers
- Trend-following generation

## 🚦 System Requirements

Your backend already has everything needed:

- ✅ **Autonomous Agent Framework**
- ✅ **Meme Collection Tools** (Reddit, Imgur, 9GAG)
- ✅ **Meme Analysis Tools** (OCR, template matching)
- ✅ **Meme Generation Tools** (AI-powered, template-based)
- ✅ **Unified Memory System**
- ✅ **RAG System for Knowledge Storage**
- ✅ **LLM Integration**

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Start the Agent
```bash
python launch_meme_agent.py
```

### Check Generated Memes
```bash
ls memes/generated/
```

### Monitor Collection
```bash
ls memes/collected/
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check LLM Configuration**: Ensure Ollama or your preferred LLM provider is running
2. **Verify Internet Connection**: The agent needs web access for meme collection
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the agent can create directories and files
4. **Review Logs**: Check the console output for detailed error messages

## 🎉 What Makes This Special

Your meme agent is built on a **revolutionary autonomous agent framework** with:

- **Full Autonomy**: Makes decisions independently
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves over time
- **Memory Integration**: Remembers what works
- **Goal-Oriented**: Pursues specific objectives
- **Self-Modification**: Adapts its behavior
- **Proactive Behavior**: Takes initiative

## 🚀 Ready to Launch?

Your autonomous meme agent is ready to go! Just run:
