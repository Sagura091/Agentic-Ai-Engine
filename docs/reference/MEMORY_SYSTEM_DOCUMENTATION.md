# Agent Workflows

This document explains how agents work internally, including their execution flow, decision-making process, and interaction patterns.

## 🔄 Agent Execution Flow

### High-Level Overview

```
User Input → Agent Receives → Think → Act → Observe → Respond
                                ↑            ↓
                                └────────────┘
                              (Loop until done)
```

### Detailed Flow

```
1. Receive Input
   ├─ Parse user message
   ├─ Load conversation context
   └─ Retrieve relevant memory

2. Context Building
   ├─ System prompt
   ├─ Conversation history
   ├─ RAG results (if enabled)
   ├─ Available tools
   └─ Agent state

3. LLM Processing
   ├─ Send context to LLM
   ├─ Stream response
   └─ Parse output

4. Decision Point
   ├─ Final answer? → Go to step 7
   └─ Need tool? → Go to step 5

5. Tool Execution
   ├─ Identify tool and parameters
   ├─ Execute tool
   ├─ Capture result
   └─ Add to context

6. Observation
   ├─ Analyze tool result
   ├─ Update agent state
   └─ Go to step 3 (loop)

7. Response Generation
   ├─ Format final response
   ├─ Save to memory
   └─ Return to user
```

## 🤖 Agent Types and Their Workflows

### 1. Basic Agent

**Use Case:** Simple question-answering, no complex reasoning

**Workflow:**
```
Input → LLM → Output
```

**Example:**
```
User: "What is the capital of France?"
Agent: "The capital of France is Paris."
```

**Characteristics:**
- Single LLM call
- No tool usage
- No multi-step reasoning
- Fast and simple

### 2. ReAct Agent

**Use Case:** Complex tasks requiring reasoning and tool usage

**Workflow:**
```
Input → Think → Act → Observe → Think → ... → Answer
```

**Example:**
```
User: "What's the weather in Paris and convert the temperature to Fahrenheit?"

Thought: I need to get the weather in Paris first
Action: weather_tool(location="Paris")
Observation: Temperature is 20°C

Thought: Now I need to convert 20°C to Fahrenheit
Action: calculator(expression="20 * 9/5 + 32")
Observation: 68°F

Thought: I have all the information needed
Answer: The weather in Paris is 20°C (68°F)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Multi-step reasoning
- Tool usage
- Explicit thinking process
- More powerful but slower

### 3. Autonomous Agent

**Use Case:** Long-running tasks with self-directed goals

**Workflow:**
```
Goal → Plan → Execute → Evaluate → Adjust → ... → Complete
```

**Example:**
```
Goal: "Research and write a report on AI trends"

Plan:
1. Search for AI trends
2. Analyze findings
3. Organize information
4. Write report
5. Save to file

Execute:
- Step 1: [web_search] → Found 10 articles
- Step 2: [analyze] → Identified 5 key trends
- Step 3: [organize] → Created outline
- Step 4: [write] → Generated report
- Step 5: [file_save] → Saved report.md

Evaluate: All steps completed successfully
Complete: Report ready at report.md
```

**Characteristics:**
- Goal-oriented
- Self-planning
- Long-running
- Adaptive

## 🧠 ReAct Pattern Deep Dive

The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern is the most commonly used workflow.

### ReAct Loop

```python
while not done:
    # 1. THINK: Reason about what to do next
    thought = llm.generate(
        context=current_context,
        prompt="What should I do next?"
    )
    
    # 2. ACT: Decide on action
    if thought.indicates_final_answer():
        done = True
        final_answer = thought.answer
    else:
        action = thought.extract_action()
        tool = get_tool(action.tool_name)
        
        # 3. OBSERVE: Execute and observe result
        observation = tool.execute(action.parameters)
        
        # 4. UPDATE: Add to context
        current_context.add(thought, action, observation)

return final_answer
```

### Example Trace

```
User: "Find the population of Tokyo and calculate how many people that is per square kilometer if Tokyo is 2,194 km²"

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Iteration 1:

Thought: I need to find the population of Tokyo first. I'll use the web search tool.

Action: web_search
Parameters: {"query": "Tokyo population 2024"}

Observation: Tokyo has a population of approximately 14 million people.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Iteration 2:

Thought: Now I have the population (14 million) and the area (2,194 km²). I need to calculate the population density.

Action: calculator
Parameters: {"expression": "14000000 / 2194"}

Observation: 6380.31

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Iteration 3:

Thought: I have all the information I need. Tokyo has 14 million people in 2,194 km², which is about 6,380 people per km².

Action: Final Answer

Answer: Tokyo has a population of approximately 14 million people. With an area of 2,194 km², the population density is about 6,380 people per square kilometer.

## 🔄 State Management

### Agent State Lifecycle

```
Created → Initializing → Ready → Active → Paused → Active → ... → Stopped
    ↓          ↓          ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓              ↓
  Config    Load LLM   Idle    Processing  Wait   Resume        Cleanup
```

### State Transitions

```python
class AgentState(Enum):
    CREATED = "created"
    INITIALIZING = "initializing"
    READY = "ready"
    ACTIVE = "active"
    PAUSED = "paused"
    ERROR = "error"
    STOPPED = "stopped"

# Allowed transitions
TRANSITIONS = {
    CREATED: [INITIALIZING],
    INITIALIZING: [READY, ERROR],
    READY: [ACTIVE, STOPPED],
    ACTIVE: [READY, PAUSED, ERROR, STOPPED],
    PAUSED: [ACTIVE, STOPPED],
    ERROR: [INITIALIZING, STOPPED],
    STOPPED: []
}
```

## 🎯 Decision-Making Process

### How Agents Make Decisions

```
1. Analyze Current Situation
   ├─ What is the user asking?
   ├─ What information do I have?
   └─ What information do I need?

2. Evaluate Options
   ├─ Can I answer directly?
   ├─ Do I need to use tools?
   ├─ Which tools are relevant?
   └─ What's the best approach?

3. Select Action
   ├─ If confident → Answer directly
   ├─ If need info → Use tool
   └─ If uncertain → Ask for clarification

4. Execute Action
   └─ Perform selected action

5. Evaluate Result
   ├─ Did it work?
   ├─ Do I have enough information now?
   └─ What should I do next?
```

### Example Decision Tree

```
User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
    ↓
Have weather data? ──No──→ Use weather_tool
    │                           ↓
    Yes                    Got result?
    ↓                           ↓
Return cached data         Yes → Return weather
                               ↓
                          No → Report error
```

## 🔁 Conversation Flow

### Multi-Turn Conversation

```
Turn 1:
User: "I need to analyze sales data"
Agent: "I can help with that. What format is your data in?"

Turn 2:
User: "It's in a CSV file"
Agent: "Great! Please upload the CSV file or provide the file path."

Turn 3:
User: "Here's the file: sales_2024.csv"
Agent: [Reads file] "I've loaded the data. What analysis would you like?"

Turn 4:
User: "Show me monthly trends"
Agent: [Analyzes data] "Here are the monthly sales trends: [chart]"
```

### Context Maintenance

```
Each Turn:
    ├─ Previous messages (context)
    ├─ Current message
    ├─ Agent state
    └─ Shared artifacts (files, data)
    ↓
Agent maintains:
    ├─ What we're working on
    ├─ What's been done
    ├─ What's next
    └─ User preferences
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing

```
User Query
    ↓
Parallel:
    ├─ RAG Search
    ├─ Memory Retrieval
    └─ Tool Preparation
    ↓
Wait for All
    ↓
Combine Results
    ↓
Send to LLM
```

### Caching Strategy

```
Request
    ↓
Check Cache:
    ├─ Exact match? → Return cached
    ├─ Similar query? → Use as context
    └─ No match → Process normally
    ↓
Process
    ↓
Cache Result
```

## 🎓 Learning from Experience

### Feedback Loop

```
Agent Action
    ↓
Observe Result
    ↓
Evaluate:
    ├─ Success? → Reinforce pattern
    └─ Failure? → Avoid pattern
    ↓
Update Memory
    ↓
Improve Future Decisions
```
