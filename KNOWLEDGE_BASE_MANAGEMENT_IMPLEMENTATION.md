## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/v1/endpoints/rag.py`)
```python
# Knowledge Base Management Endpoints
POST   /api/v1/rag/knowledge-bases              # Create knowledge base
GET    /api/v1/rag/knowledge-bases              # List knowledge bases
GET    /api/v1/rag/knowledge-bases/{kb_id}      # Get knowledge base details
PUT    /api/v1/rag/knowledge-bases/{kb_id}      # Update knowledge base
DELETE /api/v1/rag/knowledge-bases/{kb_id}      # Delete knowledge base
POST   /api/v1/rag/knowledge-bases/{kb_id}/documents  # Upload documents
GET    /api/v1/rag/knowledge-bases/use-cases    # Get available use cases
```

#### 2. **Data Models**
```python
class KnowledgeBaseCreateRequest(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str]
    use_case: str
    tags: Optional[List[str]]
    embedding_model: Optional[str]
    is_public: bool

class KnowledgeBaseUpdateRequest(BaseModel):
    description: Optional[str]
    tags: Optional[List[str]]
    is_public: Optional[bool]
```

#### 3. **Service Layer** (`app/services/rag_service.py`)
- Enhanced RAG service with collection management
- `create_collection()` method for creating new collections
- `delete_collection()` method for removing collections
- Integration with ChromaDB vector store

#### 4. **ChromaDB Integration**
- Each knowledge base creates a unique ChromaDB collection
- Collection naming convention: `kb_{use_case}_{name}`
- Isolated vector spaces for each knowledge base
- Automatic embedding generation and storage

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **Knowledge Base Management Page** (`frontend/src/pages/KnowledgeBaseManagement.tsx`)
- **Overview Tab**: Statistics and metrics dashboard
- **Browse Tab**: Grid view of all knowledge bases
- **Create Modal**: Form for creating new knowledge bases
- **Upload Modal**: Document upload interface

#### 2. **API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
```typescript
export const knowledgeBaseApi = {
  createKnowledgeBase,
  listKnowledgeBases,
  getKnowledgeBase,
  updateKnowledgeBase,
  deleteKnowledgeBase,
  uploadDocument,
  getUseCases,
  searchKnowledgeBase
}
```

#### 3. **Navigation Integration**
- Added "Knowledge Bases" menu item in sidebar
- Route: `/knowledge-bases`
- Icon: BookOpen (from Lucide React)

## üöÄ Usage Workflow

### Creating a Knowledge Base
1. Navigate to "Knowledge Bases" in the sidebar
2. Click "Create Knowledge Base" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the knowledge base
   - **Description**: Optional description of purpose
   - **Use Case**: Select from predefined categories
   - **Tags**: Add relevant tags for organization
   - **Public/Private**: Set visibility
4. Click "Create" to create the knowledge base

### Uploading Documents
1. In the Knowledge Bases page, find your knowledge base
2. Click "Upload Docs" button
3. Select files to upload (supports multiple files)
4. Documents are automatically:
   - Chunked into smaller segments
   - Converted to embeddings
   - Stored in the knowledge base's ChromaDB collection

### Searching Knowledge Bases
1. Use the search functionality to find specific knowledge bases
2. Filter by use case category
3. Search within specific knowledge bases for documents
4. Semantic search powered by ChromaDB embeddings

## üìä Features Demonstrated

### Dashboard Statistics
- Total knowledge bases count
- Total documents across all knowledge bases
- Total storage size
- Public vs private knowledge base counts
- Use case distribution visualization

### Knowledge Base Cards

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### ChromaDB Collection Management
```python
# Collection naming convention
collection_name = f"kb_{request.use_case}_{request.name}".lower().replace(" ", "_")

# Example: "kb_customer_support_help_desk"
```

### Document Storage Structure
```python
# Document metadata includes:
{
    "knowledge_base_id": "kb_customer_support_help_desk",
    "uploaded_by": "user_id",
    "uploaded_at": "2025-09-12T12:00:00Z",
    "title": "Customer Service Guide",
    "document_type": "text/plain"
}
```
